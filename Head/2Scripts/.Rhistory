# bladder: Urothelial stem cells localize in the basal cell layer and can generate all types of urothelial cells: Under homeostatic conditions, the adult urothelium is quiescent with one of the slowest turnover rates amongst mammalian epithelia (Hicks, 1975; Jost and Potten, 1986; Jost, 1989), however, there is a dramatic upregulation in urothelial proliferation in response to injury, which results in complete restoration of newly differentiated superficial cells within 72 hours

# bladder: Urothelial stem cells localize in the basal cell layer and can generate all types of urothelial cells: Under homeostatic conditions, the adult urothelium is quiescent with one of the slowest turnover rates amongst mammalian epithelia (Hicks, 1975; Jost and Potten, 1986; Jost, 1989), however, there is a dramatic upregulation in urothelial proliferation in response to injury, which results in complete restoration of newly differentiated superficial cells within 72 hours
